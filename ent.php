   <h3>ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat) - Overview</h3>
<p>This is a specialty dealing with ear, nose and throat diseases, which includes most of the head and neck ailments. It is located on the Ist floor of outpatient offices of the doctor's "B" Wing at the Gate No.-2. The department also has a sophisticated audiology and speech therapy centre with the state of art diagnostic and therapeutic facilities. The department is dedicated to expanding the frontiers of diagnosis, treatment and research of disorders of the ear, nose and sinuses , throat and the anterior skull base. Excellence is demonstrated daily through center's sophisticated use of flexible and rigid endoscopes, newly developed video camera system and fine binocular microscopes. With the help of world class equipment available in our outpatient department several procedures like endoscopic cauterization in epistaxis patient and biopsies of certain nose and throat lesions could be performed. More cases of foreign bodies in this region can be removed with ease. Clinical objectives are attained through close collaboration with the specialties of neurology, neurosurgery, pulmonology, radiology, anesthesia, internal medicine, allergy, radiotherapy, oncology, and immunology. We also share our thoughts and have case discussions in the regular seminar forum held in our hospital.</p>
